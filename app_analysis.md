- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and debugging

### 3. Project Management
- **Full Project Generation**: Creates complete project structures from descriptions
- **File Management**: CRUD operations on project files
- **Project Templates**: Supports various tech stacks and frameworks
- **Export Capabilities**: ZIP file downloads of projects

### 4. Cloud Deployment
- **Multi-Platform Support**: 
  - Vercel deployment
  - Netlify deployment  
  - Local preview server
- **Automated Setup**: Generates platform-specific configuration files
- **Deployment Tracking**: Monitors deployment status and URLs

### 5. Database Integration
- **MongoDB Storage**: Persistent storage for:
  - Chat history
  - Project metadata
  - Deployment records
  - User sessions
  - Code execution logs

## User Workflow

1. **Authentication**: User logs in through the modern login interface
2. **AI Chat**: Interact with AI assistant to generate code snippets
3. **Project Creation**: Transform code into full projects with proper structure
4. **Code Editing**: Modify and enhance generated code in the built-in editor
5. **Testing**: Execute code safely in sandboxed environment
6. **Deployment**: Deploy projects to cloud platforms with one click

## Key Differentiators
